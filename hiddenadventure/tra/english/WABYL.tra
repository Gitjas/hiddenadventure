@0    = ~Honourable Magistrate, we found out who killed Moira Delryn: Two workers who are at the service of my family - an elf called Stanial and a dwarf called Ollik. They broke into my father's estate and murdered Moira in anger after they searched for something valuable to steal in vain, and my sister was unable to give them anything.~
@1    = ~Stanial and Ollik? I know those names... These two had reported to the Magistrates' office many times... something about being owed salary by Cor Delryn, which he had refused to pay... But how do you know that these two are responsible?~
@2    = ~We found someone who witnessed the murder, she has remained silent out of fear. And has asked us not to share her identity just yet. However, she has seen it all and there is no doubt that these two men killed both Moira Delryn and the house guard.~
@3    = ~I see... Look for Captain Alwesk in the garrison at the Docks. He was leading the investigation of the murder of Moira Delryn, before he was transferred due to his... 'drastic' interrogation techniques. Maybe he can help you find these two alleged murderers.~
@4    = ~Thank you, honourable Magistrate. We will pay him a visit immediately and bring these two murderers to justice!~
@5    = ~Remember, as a Knight of the Order you cannot practice self justice, Sir Anomen. Find Captain Alwesk, tell him what you told me, and leave all further steps to him.~
@6    = ~We will. Let's go, Anomen.~
@7    = ~Very well. Let's get going, Anomen - let's get this over with!~
