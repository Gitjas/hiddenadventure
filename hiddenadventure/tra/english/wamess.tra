@0    = ~Sir Anomen, I come on behalf of the honorable Magistrate Bylanna. She insists that you receive a special reward for your efforts in this delicate matter. On behalf of the Council, I present to you the family shield of your house and a helmet which belonged to your heroic ancestors, which were kept in our charge.~
@1    = ~But – these were taken by my father and refused to me, when I would not harm Saerk! Father said I was no longer fit to wear them!~
@2    = ~Apparently, the Magistrate iagrees that you are far more worthy to wear them than your father was. Farewell, I will take my leave now.~
@3    = ~My... my thanks, good man. Always I will keep my family heirlooms in honour, for as long as I breathe. I will do everything possible to be more worthy of them!~
