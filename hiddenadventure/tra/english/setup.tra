Thanks to your "little debauchery" at the Delryn estate, I can no longer risk using you there as spies - nor let you just walk around the city. Even though there are officially no witnesses, I have to make sure that neither of you are associated with me!
It is only because of the services that you have already shown me that I am so generous to get you a hiding place instead of simply "disappearing" you.
Through my business relationships with Renal Bloodscalp and the shadow thieves, I've rented a house in the bridge district, opposite the Temple of Helm. The rumors that the place is haunted should offer you enough security until the dust has settled.

As long as you adhere to the following rules, you will not have any problems:
1. Do not leave the house, unless I give you instructions!
2. Do not take anything from what is stored there - the Shadow Thieves do not like it if their stuff is being touched!
3. Do not, under any circumstances, enter the vault in the basement. Renal was quite adamant that no one has access - those who enter will regret it!

If you follow these simple rules, you will remain safe.

@3014		 = ~Lieutenant Jaiken~
@3015		 = ~In pursuit of Moira's assassins

We found the assassins Stanial and Ollik in a tidy little hiding place. We have contacted the Captain. A note inside Stanial's pocket proves Saerk Farradh has dealings with the Shadow Thieves.

Captain Alwesk will certainly be delighted. Two assassins neutralised and a nice reward for the information - what more could one want?~
@3016		 = ~In pursuit of Moira's assassins

The meeting with Captain Alwesk was very enlightening. He seems to be a capable man, consistent, confident and calculating. Despite his harsh tone of voice, he was ready to help look for the assassins Stanial and Ollik. While he asks around in the Docks, we should look for the two soldiers the Captain is missing. The Captain says the two frequented the Delosar's Inn in the Bridge District, we should start there.

In the meantime, I hope his investigations will be successful ...~
@3017		 = ~In pursuit of Moira's assassins

Captain Alwesk has figured out where the assassins Stanial and Ollik were hiding! There is a house in the Bridge District, which is located opposite to the Temple of Helm. According to the Captain, the building belonged to the Shadow Thieves, who sold it to Saerk Farradh, Cor Delryn's rival!

After some initial consideration the Captain allowed us to pursue the two assassins and he also offered a reward should we come across evidence which suggested a connection between Saerk and the Shadow Thieves.~
@3018		 = ~In pursuit of Moira's assassins

Magistrate Bylanna was surprised with our latest findings, because the two in question apparently tried to enter a lawsuit against Lord Cor in front of the Magistrate. She advised us to talk to Captain Alwesk in the garrison at the Docks. She also asked Anomen not to take matters into his own hands and leave the arrest of Stanial and Ollik to the Captain.~
@3019		 = ~In pursuit of Moira's assassins

During our stay in Athkatla we were approached by a mysterious person. This person seemed to know who murdered Anomen's sister Moira! Contrary to the findings of the Guard, the person claimed there was a witness to the murder, which can help us solve the case. To find this witness, we should talk to a barmaid at the Mithrest Inn. According to our unknown 'ally' she should be able to help us.~
@3020		 = ~In pursuit of Moira's assassins

As it turns out, the mysterious witness was none other than the barmaid Rebecca, who once worked at Delryn's Estate and was a friend to Moira. She told us how she secretly paid Moira a visit, before they were surprised by two burglars. Rebecca was able to hide in time and watched as one of the two killed Moira. Willem was also killed. Fortunately, Rebecca overheard the villains' names before they fled the scene: Stanial and Ollik.
Anomen recognized their names as disgruntled warehouse workers under the service of his father. He has urged that we report to Magistrate Bylanna with our findings.~
@3021		  = ~In pursuit of Moira's assassins

Captain Alwesk was very pleased to hear that everything went according to plan.
However, fate had prepared more surprises for us: a messenger told us that Anomen's father, Lord Cor, decided to personally take revenge on the alleged assassins of his daughter. Worried, Anomen left for Farradh's estate.
Captain Alwesk feared that the matter might turn bad if I do not follow Anomen ï¿½ a fear that I share. I will not let anything happen to Anomen and, if necessary, I will also protect him from himself, should it come to a confrontation with Saerk.~

As for me, this matter is closed. If Anomen wants to help his foolish father, he can do it. Most likely, the consequences will be most unpleasant.~
@3023		   = ~In pursuit of Moira's assassins

We arrived at the estate of the merchant just in time to help Anomen stop his father from trying to kill Saerk. In a heated discussion, it turned out that none other that Surayah Farradh, Saerk's daughter, was our mysterious informant! She was a friend to Moira despite the hostility between their two houses and helped us find Moira's murderers. However, she did not know that the two criminals were working for her father, and also nothing of Saerk's dealings with the Shadow Thieves!
Before it could come to blows, Saerk, his son Yusef and Anomen's father were all arrested by the guard. It has taken long, but the case of Moira's murder has finally been laid to rest. I hope it will help Anomen find some peace.~
